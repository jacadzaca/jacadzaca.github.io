        <b>TL;DR</b>: I spend too much time on the Internet, should find some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fren">frens</a> and go out more lol?
            <p>
                Over the past three years, I've developed this odd habit of writing down <b>everything</b>
                I do in my calendar. I've developed the habit mostly out of curiosity: I wanted to know how much
                time I spend on the Internet, playing video games, programming etc. Besides, I'm rather sentimental.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last week, I realized that having one calendar doesn't actually allow me to do that, because each
                event has a unique name (e.g if a play some video concrete game I write down that I'm playing concretely it).
                That means that running some <em>simple</em> script, on the calendar, to sum the events' durations
                would not be plausible (just imagine the regex!). I should have several calendars, so that I
                could sort each event in to its proper category.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Categories</h2>
                Coming up with the categories turned out to be more difficult that I've anticipated.
                They should be both not too specific, yet not too broad, so the 'time spent on X statistic' wouldn't
                be complete bullocks.
                Should working out be considered its own category, or should I just put it under the 'necessary,
                cannot live without it, but boring' label? Is distro-hopping programming related?
                Should competitive programming be considered as studying or as programming? In the end, I've converged on these ten different categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>relaxing (basically every time, when I don't do anything 'productive' and don't browse the Internet)</li>
                    <li>studying (that includes reading books; dose not include homework)</li>
                    <li>programming (includes distro-hopping and such)</li>
                    <li>chores (includes homework, working, being at, going to and coming back from school, shopping etc.)</li>
                    <li>social (includes writing emails)</li>
                    <li>internet (does NOT include responsible usage; e.g. looking up public transport info)</li>
                    <li>games (video games, not board games or whatever - that goes into social)</li>
                    <li>movies (watching them, NOT going to cinema - that's social... sometimes)</li>
                    <li>blog</li>
                    <li>life (the 'necessary, cannot live without it, but boring' category. Does include working out, because my life quality would decrease without it)</li>
                </ul>
                Splitting the calendar (nearly 10k events) proved to be impossible by hand; wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacadzaca/ical-utils/main/split_calendar.py">script</a> for it.
                I concur that some events that should be in the 'chores' category landed in the 'life' category, but only pedants would notice that.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <a target="_blank" href="/pix/calendar.png"><img src="/pix/calendar.png"></img></a>
                <p>
                Basically, over the last three years I've spent around 36.8% of my time on mindless Internet browsing, while allocating
                about 2.3% of it to being 'off the grid' (relaxing + social).
                On the other hand, I've used about 37% of my time on doing useful stuff (i.e programming, studying/reading and chores; the number goes down to 22.7%, if
                doing chores would NOT to be included).
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                Well, it's kind of problematic to draw conclusion from my 'experiment', because... I have no clue what the average might be.
                How can I tell if I'm doing 'good', whether I'm spending too much (or too little?) time on the Internet, studying etc?
                Besides, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antecedent">antecedent</a> (that's literally the fanciest word I know)
                presupposes that the average even exist or is possible to 'compute'! Nonetheless, I surely should try leaving my basement more often, because with that 2.3% staying constant I will
                either lose eyesight or die from vitamin D deficiency - not going outside is surely not <a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lindy&page=2">lindy</a>.
                I also like how calendaring makes me think about my life - when you go on to write down yet another five hour long mindless Internet browsing session, you kinda start to doubt your life decisions lol.
                It kinda functions like Benjamin Franklin's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin#Thirteen_Virtues">13 Virtues</a> [<a target="_blank" href="https://daringtolivefully.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/13-virtues-chart.jpg">sample chart</a>]

                <p>
        I've finally got around to installing Arch Linux on my laptop.
        Installing Arch was simple enough, the only problem that I've had
        was understanding the difference between a boot partition and a
        'boot partition'. A BIOS boot partition is a type of a partition, whereas
        a 'boot partition' is a partition you create for your /boot/ directory -
        you don't actually need a 'boot partition', while a boot partition
        is more or less required - manually telling your boot loader
        (most likely GRUB) where everything is located is way too tedious.
            <p>
            <h2>Programs I run</h2>
            The first thing that I installed was GNOME3. I run GNOME on my
            Ubuntu desktop and it works just fine, I especially like the DE; it
            looks nice out of the box and the Activities tab is amazing. But
            that's mutter36 (mutter is the GNOME DE). mutter40 is nothing like it.
            As of now I run <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce">xfce4</a>
            on my laptop and it's alright, albeit a little retro. Actually, xfce's so
            vintage that it might be the best desktop environment for
            an eldery person, but that's neither here or there.
            I'm actually thinking of switching to <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">
            dwm</a> or <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, but I'm yet
            to decide which one is better. For the login manager I've chosen
            LightDM - it just worked.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don't run <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.html">NetworkManager</a>, because
            I have no need for it - just connecting to wi-fi with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd">iwd</a>
            and running a dhcpcd daemon in the background works for me. I also
            installed an <a href="https://github.com/J-Lentz/iwgtk">iwd frontend program</a>,
            because some normal person might have to input a wi-fi password into my
            laptop someday.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udisks">udisks</a> with
            <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/community/udiskie/udiskie.8.en">udiskie</a>
            for automating USB mounting. I also run gvfs, so I can have a Trash bin (which
            is less useful than I've thought). gvfs also seems to provide an
            alternative to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Insync">insync</a>, but
            it remains unclear whether you can actually use gvfs effectively without all the
            GNOME bloat.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS">CUPS</a> directly
            for printer manging. I even have a desktop shortcut to a
            <a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/chromium-browser#--app">chromium app</a>
            that starts the CUPS web gui.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also considered installing a cron-like program (most probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron">anacron</a>)
            and running a simple pacman update script, but after a little <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=83118">
                research</a>, I've decided to postpone creating such cron job.
            If after a while of updating nothing breaks, I will surely consider it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            As of now, Arch Linux is my favourite distro; it boots faster than
            Ubuntu, it eats a lot less RAM (which is cool, becouse now I can
            brag on the internet about how little memory my setup needs) and the
            package manager seems to be full of useful programs, especially
            compared to apt. Also, there's AUR, which looks like a both more
            managable and faster version of snap,
            </p>

                 You can go to the previous/next page, you can look through your bookmarks, you can
                 even copy the URL of the page you are looking at.

                While being able search your bookmarks etc. is all fun and games, all Vimium's feature pale in comparison
                to link hints. By default, pressing ctrl-f will make little boxes with letters (called link hints)
                appear next to all the links on the web-page. You now are only (at most) two key-strokes away from
                <b>clicking</b> that link!

                You can customize the boxes' look with CSS, however the feature seems to be a little clunky -
                CSS sometimes only loads after refreshing a page.

            Browsers have a built-in dark mode!
            As I am a dark mode <em>connoisseur</em>, I've decided to enable it in my
            browser.
            <p>The first thing that popped into my head was to check the
            <i>chrome://settings/appearance</i>
            page, but it turned out that the theme there was already set to a dark one.
            </p>
            <p>I had to dig deeper.</p>
            After a moment of googling, I've discovered the
            <i>chrome://flags/</i> page,
            where I've found the <i>Web Platform Controls Dark Mode</i> and
            the <i>Force Dark Mode for Web Contents</i> options, which I enabled
            both. The first option was the one I was looking for, but the second was the
            one I was <em>really</em> looking for. It forces <em>every</em> page to
            render in dark mode, to be honest it makes some pages look a little clunky,
            but they are still usable:
            <hr>

            <hr>
            <h2>What if I don't use Chrome?</h2>
            During my search, I've also stumbled upon this <a target="_blank" href="https://darkreader.org/">plugin</a>,
            it works with every popular browser, including Chrome (in my opinion though,
            it produces worse looking pages than the naitive option).
