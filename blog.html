            Aren't you tired of having to use your mouse in order to click a link?
            Of course you are, but worry no more - there exists a remedy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium">Vimium</a> is a browser
                (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">download for Chrome</a>,
                 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/">download for Firefox</a>)
                 extension that binds all the functionality that you would need to some key combination.
                 You can go to the previous/next page, you can look through your bookmarks, you can
                 even copy the URL of the page you are looking at.

                 <a href="/pix/vimium.png"><img src="/pix/vimium.png" title="full list of vimium's keybinds"></img></a>
                 <hr>
                 What's also great is the fact that you remap Vimium's key-binds how you like.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Link hints</h2>
                While being able search your bookmarks etc. is all fun and games, all Vimium's feature pale in comparison
                to link hints. By default, pressing ctrl-f will make little boxes with letters (called link hints)
                appear next to all the links on the web-page. You now are only (at most) two key-strokes away from
                <b>clicking</b> that link!

                </video>
                <hr>
                You can customize the boxes' look with CSS, however the feature seems to be a little clunky -
                CSS sometimes only loads after refreshing a page.

            By the way, I've brought back a <a href="/redpandalore/index.html">ridiculously random site</a> about red pandas.
            I think it was supposed to be a fan-fiction about

            but I can't really remeber.

            Today I've discovered CSS media queries, one of which has
            especially caught my attention:
            <blockquote>
            <a target="_blank"
             href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">@media (prefers-color-scheme dark)</a>

            Browsers have a built-in dark mode!
            As I am a dark mode <em>connoisseur</em>, I've decided to enable it in my
            browser.
            <p>The first thing that popped into my head was to check the
            <i>chrome://settings/appearance</i>
            page, but it turned out that the theme there was already set to a dark one.
            </p>
            <p>I had to dig deeper.</p>
            After a moment of googling, I've discovered the
            <i>chrome://flags/</i> page,
            where I've found the <i>Web Platform Controls Dark Mode</i> and
            the <i>Force Dark Mode for Web Contents</i> options, which I enabled
            both. The first option was the one I was looking for, but the second was the
            one I was <em>really</em> looking for. It forces <em>every</em> page to
            render in dark mode, to be honest it makes some pages look a little clunky,
            but they are still usable:
            <hr>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 10px" src="/pix/clunky.png" title="there is some white stuff there, yuck!">
            <img src="/pix/clunky1.png" title="the empty levels are not visible, the puppets arms are barely visible">
            <hr>
            <h2>What if I don't use Chrome?</h2>
            During my search, I've also stumbled upon this <a target="_blank" href="https://darkreader.org/">plugin</a>,
            it works with every popular browser, including Chrome (in my opinion though,
            it produces worse looking pages than the naitive option).

        I've decided to take up blogging. I'm mainly going to
        write about programming, but from time to time I will write a piece about
        some cool math fact that I've learned or a book review. I plan to keep the
        site bare-bones (<b>no js!</b>), because I belive that the web should be faster.
        <br>
        To build this website, I've rolled out my own static site generator (e.g. a
        few python3 scripts and some jinja templates), which you can find <a href="https://github.com/jacadzaca/blog-gen" target="_blank">here</a>.
