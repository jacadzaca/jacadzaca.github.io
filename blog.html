            <blockquote id="btw i use arch">
                <p>
        I've finally got around to installing Arch Linux on my laptop.
        Installing Arch was simple enough, the only problem that I've had
        was understanding the difference between a boot partition and a
        'boot partition'. A BIOS boot partition is a type of a partition, whereas
        a 'boot partition' is a partition you create for your /boot/ directory -
        you don't actually need a 'boot partition', while a boot partition
        is more or less required - manually telling your boot loader
        (most likely GRUB) where everything is located is way too tedious.
            <p>
            <h2>Programs I run</h2>
            The first thing that I installed was GNOME3. I run GNOME on my
            Ubuntu desktop and it works just fine, I especially like the DE; it
            looks nice out of the box and the Activities tab is amazing. But
            that's mutter36 (mutter is the GNOME DE). mutter40 is nothing like it.
            As of now I run <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce">xfce4</a>
            on my laptop and it's alright, albeit a little retro. Actually, xfce's so
            vintage that it might be the best desktop environment for
            an eldery person, but that's neither here or there.
            I'm actually thinking of switching to <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">
            dwm</a> or <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, but I'm yet
            to decide which one is better. For the login manager I've chosen
            LightDM - it just worked.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don't run <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.html">NetworkManager</a>, because
            I have no need for it - just connecting to wi-fi with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd">iwd</a>
            and running a dhcpcd daemon in the background works for me. I also
            installed an <a href="https://github.com/J-Lentz/iwgtk">iwd frontend program</a>,
            because some normal person might have to input a wi-fi password into my
            laptop someday.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udisks">udisks</a> with
            <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/community/udiskie/udiskie.8.en">udiskie</a>
            for automating USB mounting. I also run gvfs, so I can have a Trash bin (which
            is less useful than I've thought). gvfs also seems to provide an
            alternative to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Insync">insync</a>, but
            it remains unclear whether you can actually use gvfs effectively without all the
            GNOME bloat.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS">CUPS</a> directly
            for printer manging. I even have a desktop shortcut to a
            <a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/chromium-browser#--app">chromium app</a>
            that starts the CUPS web gui.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also considered installing a cron-like program (most probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron">anacron</a>)
            and running a simple pacman update script, but after a little <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=83118">
                research</a>, I've decided to postpone creating such cron job.
            If after a while of updating nothing breaks, I will surely consider it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            As of now, Arch Linux is my favourite distro; it boots faster than
            Ubuntu, it eats a lot less RAM (which is cool, becouse now I can
            brag on the internet about how little memory my setup needs) and the
            package manager seems to be full of useful programs, especially
            compared to apt. Also, there's AUR, which looks like a both more
            managable and faster version of snap,
            </p>

            Aren't you tired of having to use your mouse in order to click a link?
            Of course you are, but worry no more - there exists a remedy.

                 extension that binds all the functionality that you would need to some key combination.
                 You can go to the previous/next page, you can look through your bookmarks, you can
                 even copy the URL of the page you are looking at.

                <h2>Link hints</h2>
                While being able search your bookmarks etc. is all fun and games, all Vimium's feature pale in comparison
                to link hints. By default, pressing ctrl-f will make little boxes with letters (called link hints)
                appear next to all the links on the web-page. You now are only (at most) two key-strokes away from
                <b>clicking</b> that link!

                <hr>
                You can customize the boxes' look with CSS, however the feature seems to be a little clunky -
                CSS sometimes only loads after refreshing a page.

            By the way, I've brought back a <a href="/redpandalore/index.html">ridiculously random site</a> about red pandas.

            Today I've discovered CSS media queries, one of which has
            especially caught my attention:
            <blockquote>
            <a target="_blank"
             href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">@media (prefers-color-scheme dark)</a>

            Browsers have a built-in dark mode!
            As I am a dark mode <em>connoisseur</em>, I've decided to enable it in my
            browser.
            <p>The first thing that popped into my head was to check the
            <i>chrome://settings/appearance</i>
            page, but it turned out that the theme there was already set to a dark one.
            </p>
            <p>I had to dig deeper.</p>
            After a moment of googling, I've discovered the
            <i>chrome://flags/</i> page,
            where I've found the <i>Web Platform Controls Dark Mode</i> and
            the <i>Force Dark Mode for Web Contents</i> options, which I enabled
            both. The first option was the one I was looking for, but the second was the
            one I was <em>really</em> looking for. It forces <em>every</em> page to
            render in dark mode, to be honest it makes some pages look a little clunky,
            but they are still usable:
            <hr>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 10px" src="/pix/clunky.png" title="there is some white stuff there, yuck!">
            <img src="/pix/clunky1.png" title="the empty levels are not visible, the puppets arms are barely visible">
            <hr>
            <h2>What if I don't use Chrome?</h2>
            During my search, I've also stumbled upon this <a target="_blank" href="https://darkreader.org/">plugin</a>,
            it works with every popular browser, including Chrome (in my opinion though,
            it produces worse looking pages than the naitive option).

        I've decided to take up blogging. I'm mainly going to
        write about programming, but from time to time I will write a piece about
        some cool math fact that I've learned or a book review. I plan to keep the
        site bare-bones (<b>no js!</b>), because I belive that the web should be faster.
