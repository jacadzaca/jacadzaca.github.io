                reached a new level - landlord being are equated with

                <p>Landlords are said not to do any work - they just
                siphon others’ efforts. If you and your landlord earn a
                similar wage and you’re both saving for a new flat, it’s
                going to be your landlord that can buy it first,
                although they already have a place of their own. Albeit,
                a landlord makes sure your apartment is a decent place
                to live (e.g they call in a plumber once in a while) it
                doesn’t lessens their parasitism, because then they
                become a <a
                href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/We_Can_Do_It%21_NARA_535413_-_Restoration_2.jpg/463px-We_Can_Do_It%21_NARA_535413_-_Restoration_2.jpg"
                target="_blank">redundant middleman</a> (it’s not rocket
                science to call a plumber). Some might claim that
                becoming a landlord actually requires much effort - you
                must take risk, familiarize yourself with the
                appropriate laws, go around searching for a property
                etc. but why someone should bother with it all? Can’t we
                organize into housing cooperatives or establish a
                government monopoly on rentiership and thus socialize
                the trouble?</p>
                <h2 id="landlords-bad">Landlords bad?</h2>
                <p>Imagine you’re moving into city of Ekslandia - let’s
                say you’ve landed a job opportunity there. You’re pretty
                sure that you won’t stay in Ekslandia for more than N
                years. Sadly, all of the established housing
                cooperatives are already full (they provide high quality
                housing, so nobody want to leave) and the ongoing
                initiatives either will take more than N years to
                provide you with a quarter (establishing an organization
                is not a timely process) or are not welcoming of total
                strangers that hardly have a job in the city <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_cooperative"
                target="_blank">housing coops are allowed to select
                who’s to live with them</a>). You try applying for
                social housing, but it turns out that it favors people
                with turbulent past. Running out of options (and since
                people on the internet told you that all landlords do is
                exploit), you want to take out a loan and buy an
                apartment. You meet up with your financial adviser and
                he tells you that the loan over the N years that you
                plan to stay in the city will cost you X, however he
                also mentions that due to the growth of available
                housing alternatives, the typical rent has fallen
                drastically and it wouldn’t be hard to find a similar
                apartment that over the next N years will only cost you
                (X - 1). Since everyone can subtract, you quickly figure
                out that by renting you could actually save one unit of
                value… Since when does being exploited saves you
                money?</p>
                <h2 id="landlord-good">Landlord good???</h2>
                <p>Although the above story lays down a rather specific
                scenario (all ‘better’ options are unavailable, <a
                href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/rent-vs-buy-calculator"
                target="_blank">renting is cheaper</a> etc.) and thus is
                not very convincing, it’s still a scenario that seems to
                presume most of the skeptics’ propositions, while
                allowing a landlord to contribute to a society.
                Basically, what a landlord does is allowing the tenant
                not to buy an apartment; if we were to let go of some
                skeptics’ tenets, e.g that housing coops are
                <em>always</em> more economically efficient, we could
                ask whether the landlord doesn’t produce value by
                elevating the tenant from the chore of attending coop’s
                board meetings? Surly, if someone is attending a board
                meeting they are not, for example, spending time with
                their family. Summarizing, we cannot conclude whether
                landlords are cringe and useless <em>ex offico</em> -
                when a landlord grants you affordable accommodation they
                are not cringe otherwise they probably are.</p>
