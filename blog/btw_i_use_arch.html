        I've finally got around to installing Arch Linux on my laptop.
        Installing Arch was simple enough, the only problem that I've had
        was understanding the difference between a boot partition and a
        'boot partition'. A BIOS boot partition is a type of a partition, whereas
        a 'boot partition' is a partition you create for your /boot/ directory -
        you don't actually need a 'boot partition', while a boot partition
        is more or less required - manually telling your boot loader
        (most likely GRUB) where everything is located is way too tedious.
            <p>
            <h2>Programs I run</h2>
            The first thing that I installed was GNOME3. I run GNOME on my
            Ubuntu desktop and it works just fine, I especially like the DE; it
            looks nice out of the box and the Activities tab is amazing. But
            that's mutter36 (mutter is the GNOME DE). mutter40 is nothing like it.
            As of now I run <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce">xfce4</a>
            on my laptop and it's alright, albeit a little retro. Actually, xfce's so
            vintage that it might be the best desktop environment for
            an eldery person, but that's neither here or there.
            I'm actually thinking of switching to <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">
            dwm</a> or <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, but I'm yet
            to decide which one is better. For the login manager I've chosen
            LightDM - it just worked.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don't run <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.html">NetworkManager</a>, because
            I have no need for it - just connecting to wi-fi with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd">iwd</a>
            and running a dhcpcd daemon in the background works for me. I also
            installed an <a href="https://github.com/J-Lentz/iwgtk">iwd frontend program</a>,
            because some normal person might have to input a wi-fi password into my
            laptop someday.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udisks">udisks</a> with
            <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/community/udiskie/udiskie.8.en">udiskie</a>
            for automating USB mounting. I also run gvfs, so I can have a Trash bin (which
            is less useful than I've thought). gvfs also seems to provide an
            alternative to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Insync">insync</a>, but
            it remains unclear whether you can actually use gvfs effectively without all the
            GNOME bloat.
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS">CUPS</a> directly
            for printer manging. I even have a desktop shortcut to a
            <a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/chromium-browser#--app">chromium app</a>
            that starts the CUPS web gui.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also considered installing a cron-like program (most probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron">anacron</a>)
            and running a simple pacman update script, but after a little <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=83118">
                research</a>, I've decided to postpone creating such cron job.
            If after a while of updating nothing breaks, I will surely consider it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            As of now, Arch Linux is my favourite distro; it boots faster than
            Ubuntu, it eats a lot less RAM (which is cool, becouse now I can
            brag on the internet about how little memory my setup needs) and the
            package manager seems to be full of useful programs, especially
            compared to apt. Also, there's AUR, which looks like a both more
            managable and faster version of snap,
            </p>
