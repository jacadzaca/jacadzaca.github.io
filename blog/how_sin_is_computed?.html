            I can recall the first time I wrote a program that used a trigonometric function - it
            was back in secondary school. I was making a game and wanted to make some object float around
            another. Back then, I didn't know what trig functions were and how they worked, so I copied
            some code from the web and, to my astonishment, it worked. I got curious how these functions worked, so
            I pressed F3 in my IDE and tried to look for the source code of Math.sin. I can't remember whether I found
            the code and didn't understand it or whether I couldn't find the implementation at all. It doesn't really
            matter. What dose, is that back then I swore to myself that one day I will implement my own sin function.
            Two days ago, I've learned about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new#bc-10-11">Taylor Series</a>.
            <p>
            <h2>Taylors, how do they work?</h2>
            Taylor series is a tool to express some function as a polynomial, using its nth derivative.
            Since <i>sin(x)</i> and its derivatives are differentiable, we can express <i>f(x) = sin(x)</i> as:
            <pre>
            p(x) = &sum;<sub>n=0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>f<sup>(n)</sup>(a) * <sup>(x-a)<sup>n</sup></sup>&frasl;<sub>n!</sub>
            </pre>
            In this case, we can't add infinitely many terms in a finite amount of time, so we have
            to approximate. Since this is a toy implementation, we will just compare it with python's
            math.sin implementation and call it quits when they will converge <i>good enough</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            First, we need some way of obtaining the nth derivative of sin, evaluated at some center <i>a</i>.
            By writing down sin's first fifteen derivatives, we can see that the odd derivatives are either <i>1 * cos(x)</i> or
            <i>(-1) * cos(x)</i>, while the plural ones take the form of 1 * <i>sin(x)</i> or (-1) * <i>sin(x)</i>. What is more difficult
            to see, is that derivatives with an ordinal that yields a reminder of two or three when divided by four are the
            derivatives with and minus sign. I don't know how to formally prove it... <em>yet</em>, but you need to trust me on this one.
            Translating into python code:
            <pre><code>
                def nth_sin_derivative(n, a=math.pi/2):
                    if n % 4 in (2,3):
                        sign = -1
                    else:
                        sign = 1
                    if n % 2 == 0:
                        function = sin
                    else:
                        function = cos
                return sign * function(a)
            </code></pre>

            Second, we need to actually be able to evaluate both <i>cos(x)</i> and <i>sin(x)</i> at our center. Since we are implementing <i>sin(x)</i>,
            we should deal with <i>cos(x)</i> first. We don't have to implement <i>cos(x)</i> separately -  notice that <i>sin(<sup>&#960</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> - x) = cos(x)</i>:
            <code><pre>
                def cos(x):
                    return sin((math.pi/2) - x)
            </code></pre>
            Great. That solves the <i>cos(x)</i> part. Now, we can finally implement <i>sin(x)</i>:
            <code><pre>
            def sin(x, center=math.pi/2, term_count=5):
                if x == math.pi/2:
                    return 1
                elif x == 0:
                    return 0
                else:
                    values = (((x - center)**i / math.factorial(i)) * nth_sin_derivative(i, a=center) for i in range(term_count))
                    return sum(values)
            </code></pre>
            We specify two special cases: <i>x = <sup>&#960</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></i> for evaluating sin derivatives that require to compute <i>sin(x)</i> at center,
            and <i>x = 0</i> for evaluating sin derivatives that require to compute <i>cos(x)</i> at center. Else, we compute the Taylor series.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Is the implementation any good?</h2>
            Well, it sure can compute <i>sin(x)</i>! With term_count=19 the approximation is nearly as good as the python's
            math.sin:

            However, assemblies actually provide an <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/cse3101/nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.100">fsin</a> instruction, so
            computing <i>sin(x)</i> in software when speed matters is kinda cringe. On the side note, CPUs don't actually use a Taylor series
            to compute trig functions - they use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordic">CORDIC</a>.
