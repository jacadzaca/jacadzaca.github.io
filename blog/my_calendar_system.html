                <h1>my calendar system&lt;</h1>
                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I spend too much time on the
                Internet, should find some <a
                href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fren"
                target="_blank">frens</a> and go out more lol?</p>
                <p>Over the past three years, I’ve developed this odd
                habit of writing down <strong>everything</strong> I do
                in my calendar. I’ve developed the habit mostly out of
                curiosity: I wanted to know how much time I spend on the
                Internet, playing video games, programming etc. Besides,
                I’m rather sentimental.</p>
                <p>Last week, I realized that having one calendar
                doesn’t actually allow me to do that, because each event
                has a unique name (e.g if a play some video concrete
                game I write down that I’m playing concretely it). That
                means that running some <em>simple</em> script, on the
                calendar, to sum the events’ durations would not be
                plausible (just imagine the regex!). I should have
                several calendars, so that I could sort each event in to
                its proper category.</p>
                <h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
                <p>Coming up with the categories turned out to be more
                difficult that I’ve anticipated. They should be both not
                too specific, yet not too broad, so the ‘time spent on X
                statistic’ wouldn’t be complete bullocks. Should working
                out be considered its own category, or should I just put
                it under the ‘necessary, cannot live without it, but
                boring’ label? Is distro-hopping programming related?
                Should competitive programming be considered as studying
                or as programming? In the end, I’ve converged on these
                ten different categories:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>relaxing (basically every time, when I don’t do
                anything ‘productive’ and don’t browse the
                Internet)</li>
                <li>studying (that includes reading books; dose not
                include homework)</li>
                <li>programming (includes distro-hopping and such)</li>
                <li>chores (includes homework, working, being at, going
                to and coming back from school, shopping etc.)</li>
                <li>social (includes writing emails)</li>
                <li>internet (does NOT include responsible usage;
                e.g. looking up public transport info)</li>
                <li>games (video games, not board games or whatever -
                that goes into social)</li>
                <li>movies (watching them, NOT going to cinema - that’s
                social... sometimes)</li>
                <li>blog</li>
                <li>life (the ‘necessary, cannot live without it, but
                boring’ category. Does include working out, because my
                life quality would decrease without it)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Splitting the calendar (nearly 10k events) proved to
                be impossible by hand; wrote a <a
                href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacadzaca/ical-utils/main/split_calendar.py"
                target="_blank">script</a> for it. I concur that some
                events that should be in the ‘chores’ category landed in
                the ‘life’ category, but only pedants would notice
                that.</p>
                <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
                <hr />
                <p><a
                href="/files/images/my_calendar_system/calendar.avif"
                target="_blank"><img
                src="/files/images/my_calendar_system/calendar.avif"

                <hr />
                <p>Basically, over the last three years I’ve spent
                around 36.8% of my time on mindless Internet browsing,
                while allocating about 2.3% of it to being ‘off the
                grid’ (relaxing + social). On the other hand, I’ve used
                about 37% of my time on doing useful stuff (i.e
                programming, studying/reading and chores; the number
                goes down to 22.7%, if doing chores would NOT to be
                included).</p>
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Well, it’s kind of problematic to draw conclusion
                from my ‘experiment’, because... I have no clue what the
                average might be. How can I tell if I’m doing ‘good’,
                whether I’m spending too much (or too little?) time on
                the Internet, studying etc? Besides, the <a
                href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antecedent"
                target="_blank">antecedent</a> (that’s literally the
                fanciest word I know) presupposes that the average even
                exist or is possible to ‘compute’! Nonetheless, I surely
                should try leaving my basement more often, because with
                that 2.3% staying constant I will either lose eyesight
                or die from vitamin D deficiency - not going outside is
                surely not <a
                href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lindy&amp;page=2"
                target="_blank">lindy</a>. I also like how calendaring
                makes me think about my life - when you go on to write
                down yet another five hour long mindless Internet
                browsing session, you kinda start to doubt your life
                decisions lol. It kinda functions like Benjamin
                Franklin’s <a
