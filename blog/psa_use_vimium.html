            Aren't you tired of having to use your mouse in order to click a link?
            Of course you are, but worry no more - there exists a remedy.

                (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">download for Chrome</a>,
                 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/">download for Firefox</a>)
                 extension that binds all the functionality that you would need to some key combination.
                 You can go to the previous/next page, you can look through your bookmarks, you can
                 even copy the URL of the page you are looking at.

                 <hr>
                 What's also great is the fact that you remap Vimium's key-binds how you like.

                <h2>Link hints</h2>
                While being able search your bookmarks etc. is all fun and games, all Vimium's feature pale in comparison
                to link hints. By default, pressing ctrl-f will make little boxes with letters (called link hints)
                appear next to all the links on the web-page. You now are only (at most) two key-strokes away from
                <b>clicking</b> that link!
                You can customize the boxes' look with CSS, however the feature seems to be a little clunky -
                CSS sometimes only loads after refreshing a page.

            By the way, I've brought back a <a href="/redpandalore/index.html">ridiculously random site</a> about red pandas.
            I think it was supposed to be a fan-fiction about
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdQaSJCYS4o2eG93MvIwqg">Killian</a>,
            but I can't really remeber.
