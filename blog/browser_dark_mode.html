            Today I've discovered CSS media queries, one of which has
            especially caught my attention:
            <blockquote>
            <a target="_blank"
             href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">@media (prefers-color-scheme dark)</a>
            </blockquote>
            Browsers have a built-in dark mode!
            As I am a dark mode <em>connoisseur</em>, I've decided to enable it in my
            browser.
            <p>The first thing that popped into my head was to check the
            <i>chrome://settings/appearance</i>
            page, but it turned out that the theme there was already set to a dark one.
            </p>
            <p>I had to dig deeper.</p>
            After a moment of googling, I've discovered the
            <i>chrome://flags/</i> page,
            where I've found the <i>Web Platform Controls Dark Mode</i> and
            the <i>Force Dark Mode for Web Contents</i> options, which I enabled
            both. The first option was the one I was looking for, but the second was the
            one I was <em>really</em> looking for. It forces <em>every</em> page to
            render in dark mode, to be honest it makes some pages look a little clunky,
            but they are still usable:
            <hr>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 10px" src="/pix/clunky.png" title="there is some white stuff there, yuck!">
            <img src="/pix/clunky1.png" title="the empty levels are not visible, the puppets arms are barely visible">
            <hr>
            <h2>What if I don't use Chrome?</h2>
            During my search, I've also stumbled upon this <a target="_blank" href="https://darkreader.org/">plugin</a>,
            it works with every popular browser, including Chrome (in my opinion though,
            it produces worse looking pages than the naitive option).
