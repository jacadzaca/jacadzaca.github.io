                <h1>Building an adding machine in a prison building
game</h1>
                <p>As of late, I really got into Prison Architect. It’s
                a fantastic game - you get to plan your own prison just
                the way you like, decorate it and then see how it fares
                when ‘actual’ prisoners are living there. Also, its DLCs
                are somewhat fair-priced, which isn’t usually the case
                with Paradox’s games. I wanted to do something unique to
                express my appreciation of the game, so I built a simple
                calculator in it.</p>
                <h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
                <p>Luckily, the game features a <a
                href="https://prisonarchitect.paradoxwikis.com/Logic_Circuit"
                target="_blank">logic gate system</a>, so we don’t need
                to figure out how to simulate one using game mechanics.
                There’s also a <a
                href="https://prisonarchitect.paradoxwikis.com/Status_Light"
                target="_blank">‘status light’</a> object which lights
                up when it receives a signal, so we’ll use that as a
                building block of a display. There’s no way of cloning
                logic gates etc. with its connections to other
                utilities, so since I don’t really want to spend eons on
                connecting magical boxes in a video game (yet?), we’ll
                limit our calculator’s capabilities to adding two
                numbers with two <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal"
                target="_blank">binary coded decimal digits</a>. That
                means our calculator will be able to add 99 and 99 at
                most, so we’ll actually need three digits on the result
                display (something I’d figured out way after I built the
                displays and connected them…).</p>
                <p>I picked BCD as the encoding, because the only way of
                displaying plain binary numbers in decimal I could
                figure out was to connect each possible combinations of
                bits to AND and NOR gates, then connect the NOR gate to
                the AND gate, to then connect the AND gate to the
                display in a proper way. That means I’d have to
                mindlessly map about <em>99 + 99 + 198 = 396</em>
                possible outcomes onto the displays. With BCD, the
                number of possibilities goes down to <em>10 + 10 + 10 +
                10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 61</em>, since I only need to connect
                each digit representation with its display and the first
                digit of the result number can only be either 1 or
                0.</p>
                <p>You can add BCD digits with conventional <a
                href="%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)%22"
                target="_blank">binary adders</a>, but you <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal#Addition"
                target="_blank">might need to convert them later by
                adding six to the result and sending the carry bit to
                the next digit’s adders</a> (if that makes sense). Since
                each BCD digit uses four bits, in order to add the
                digits, we’ll need four full adders connected together
                forming a ripple carry adder (I think). Although four
                adders is enough, our big adder will consist of five
                small adders, since if the last adder outputs a carry
                bit, we will have an integer overflow. The additional
                circuit allows us to incorporate the bit into the
                computation’s result. Later, we’ll setup a bunch of NOR
                gates connected with AND gates, which will be connected
                to the output of the big adders, that will output signal
                to another set of two big adders that will preform the
                conversion, if required.</p>
                <p>Normally we’d need some-kind of a <a
                href="%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)%22"
                target="_blank">flip-flops</a> to build a keyboard with,
                but the game features an <a
                href="https://prisonarchitect.paradoxwikis.com/Power_Switch"
                target="_blank">object</a> that emits signal constantly,
                so we’ll just use it.</p>
                <h2 id="adders">Adders</h2>
                <p>We can easily implement a <a
                href="%22https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Full-adder.svg%22"
                target="_blank">full adder</a> with the game’s logic
                gates. We can then place four more adders underneath it,
                connecting them together to form the big guy. Since, for
                some reason, most in-game emitters send a high signal by
                default, we should also connect a turned off lever to
                the first adder’s carry input gates, and two turned off
                levers to the ‘screw overflow’ adder’s input. We also
                connect each adders output (the XOR gate) to a
                corresponding light at the bottom. We could directly
                connect the outputs to the next part, but I think it
                would make the build less clear (click the image to
                rotate)</p>

                <hr />
                <p>Next, I connected the lights to a bunch of NOR and
                AND gates, and these to an OR gate, so that the
                ‘circuit’ outputs signal only if the output lights form
                a binary number that is greater than nine. The signal
                then turns on the switches that are connected to a next
                big adder that adds six to a digit only when a high
                signal is emitted. However, these adders are different
                from the previous ones, because the final adder of the
                first big adder passes its carry bit to the first full
                adder of the next ripple carry adder. And the last full
                adder of the second big adder passes its carry bit to
                the leftmost bit of the output.</p>

                <h2 id="screen">Screen</h2>
                <p>The display is a straightforward beast: the rows of
                lights under the BCD converter are appropriately mapped
                to a bunch of NOR and AND gates, the NOR gates are
                inputted into the appropriate AND, so that when the AND
                gate emits a signal, lights corresponding to the
                appropriate digit light up:</p>

                <p>The light that corresponds to the hundreds digit of
                the sum is directly connected to the display, since it
                doesn’t need this kind of a dashboard.</p>
