It turns out that you can find the value of sin(18°) by the following
method:

Notice that by the sin addition formula:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation1.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation1.svg)
Also:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation2.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation2.svg)
Moreover, by the double cosine formula:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation3.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation3.svg)
Now use the Pythagorean identity like this:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation4.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation4.svg)
Now equate the right-hand side of equation 2° with the right-hand side
of statement 1°, and substitute for *cos(36°)*:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation5.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation5.svg)
Notice that for t = 1 the equation is satisfied, so:
[![](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation6.svg)](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/equation6.svg)
Now notice that *1 \> t \> 0*, because *sin(x)* is an increasing
function when *90 \> x \> 0* and *sin(90°) = 1 \> sin(18°) \> sin(0°) =
0*, so *t = sin(18°) = ^(-1\ +\ √5)^⁄~4~* , since that's the only
solutions that meets the criteria

While this method works, it's not easy to come up with the first
equation. I stumbled on it by pure coincidence. I personally prefer the
[geometrical](/files/images/other_way_of_finding_sin_of_18/geo_sin18.avif) way of finding the value of sin(18),
because it strikes me as the more obvious way of doing it.
