I've decided to take up blogging. I'm mainly going to write about
programming, but from time to time I will write a piece about some cool
math fact that I've learned or a book review. I plan to keep the site
bare-bones (**no js!**), because I believe that the web should be
faster.\
To build this website, I've rolled out my own static site generator
(e.g. a few python3 scripts and some jinja templates), which you can
find [here](https://github.com/jacadzaca/blog-gen).
