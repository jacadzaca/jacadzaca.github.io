Aren't you tired of having to use your mouse in order to click a link?
Of course you are, but worry no more - there exists a remedy.

[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) is a browser ([download for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb),
[download for
Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/))
extension that binds all the functionality that you would need to some
key combination. You can go to the previous/next page, you can look
through your bookmarks, you can even copy the URL of the page you are
looking at.

What's also great is the fact that you remap Vimium's key-binds how
you like.

## Link hints

While being able search your bookmarks etc. is all fun and games, all
Vimium's feature pale in comparison to link hints. By default, pressing
ctrl-f will make little boxes with letters (called link hints) appear
next to all the links on the web-page. You now are only (at most) two
key-strokes away from **clicking** that link! You can customize the
boxes' look with CSS, however the feature seems to be a little clunky -
CSS sometimes only loads after refreshing a page.

By the way, I've brought back a [ridiculously random
site](/redpandalore/index.html) about red pandas. I think it was
supposed to be a fan-fiction about
[Killian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdQaSJCYS4o2eG93MvIwqg), but
I can't really remeber.
