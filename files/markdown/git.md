I use [Github](https://github.com/jacadzaca) for 'development' and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jacadzaca)
as a mirror.

# 'Notable' repositories I maintain:
 - [zadanko](https://github.com/jacadzaca/zadanko) a math worksheet generator
 - [dbcpy](https://github.com/jacadzaca/dbcpy) a python library for parsing DBC files
 - [item generator](https://github.com/jacadzaca/item_generator) a simple item generator for [TrinityCore](https://trinitycore.org/)

# Contributing etiquette
 - use Github's pull request feature
 - [sign commits with your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
 - ensure that your commits have meaningful comments
 - if your contribution is big, make a separate branch
 - provide test-cases when possible
